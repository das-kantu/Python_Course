<h1>Python Lists</h1>

<h1>List</h1>
<h2>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.</h2>

<h3>Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</h3>

<b>Lists are created using square brackets:</b>
```python

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

```


<h3>List Items</h3>
<h1>List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values</h1>
<h2>List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.<h2>
  
<h3>Ordered</h3>
<h2>When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.</h2>
<b>If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.</b>

<h2>Changeable</h2>
<b>The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.</b>
<h2>Allow Duplicates</h2>
<b>Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:</b>
<h3>Example</h3>
<b>Lists allow duplicate values:</b>

```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

```
